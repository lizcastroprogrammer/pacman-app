# Pacman App

## Description
This app makes it seem like a pacman is traveling across the page using JavaScript to manipulate two different images. The first image is a pacman with its mouth open. The second is with its mouth closed. The JavaScript functions take both those images and alternate between the two while moving the image across the screen. This gives the experience of a pacman opening and closing its mouth. Also, once the pacman hits the edge of the screen it will reverse direction.
## How To Run
Once the app is loaded into the browser, all you have to do is click on the pacman to get it started.
## Future Updates
Coming soon is an update with the pacman eating dots across the page.
